A. Known bugs of xcin:
----------------------
1. Currently only "Root" and "OverTheSpot" input styles of XIM are supported. 
   The others are not.

2. XCIN still cannot repond the XIM message "XNQueryIMValuesList" to the client.
   And not all of the possible XIC requests from the client are handled. If the
   client sends unknown XIC requests to xcin, xcin will complain warning 
   message.


B. Glibc related problem:
-------------------------
1. Because glibc use UCS4 as its internal encoding, but some of the Eten
   extension characters of Big5 encoding does not have correct mapping
   to UCS4 in the glibc-2.1.x iconv data. Hence, under this situation 
   these characters will have difficulties to be exchanged between XIM
   server and clients. These characters are:

   Big5:  0xF9D6, 0xF9D7, 0xF9D8, 0xF9D9, 0xF9DA, 0xF9DB, 0xF9DC

   This problem will be fixed in the incoming glibc-2.2.x system.


C. rxvt-2.6.x/2.7.x related problem:
------------------------------------
   (See also http://xcin.linux.org.tw/rxvt/index.html for more details.
    Please also use the most recent versions of rxvt as possible, see
    http://www.rxvt.org for more detials)
    
1. In GNU/Linux running fvwm95 window manager and rxvt-2.6/7, if simultaneously
   kill xcin and rxvt (for example, shutdown the fvwm95 environment), in some
   circumstance rxvt cannot terminate properly, instead it might still hang
   in the memory to waste CPU time. In this situation the only way to terminate
   it is using "kill -9".

   I am not sure if in other window managers this situation exist or not, but
   the users using icewm / KDE told me that they never see this situation.
   So, if you see this, one way to get rid of this is before your logging out,
   terminate xcin first and then log out.

2. In zh_TW.Big5 locale and OverTheSpot input style, rxvt cannot report correct
   spot location to xcin, such that the OverTheSpot window of xcin cannot move
   with the cursor of rxvt correctly.


D. xedit related problem:
-------------------------
1. If the "international" of xedit in $HOME/.Xresources is enabled, you may
   not use xedit to open any file to edit. It will cause segmentation fault.

2. It has X11R5 problem (XIM server cannot terminate before it, cannot start
   after it).


E. Netscape-4.5/6/7 and Mozilla M16/M17 related problem:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. It has X11R5 problem (XIM server cannot terminate before it, cannot start
   after it).

2. Bug in Mozilla, the when the XICs change their input focus, they do not
   send XSetICFocus or XUnsetICFocus messages to the XIM server.


F. Gnome Window Maker related problem:
--------------------------------------
1. If the xcinrc option "XCIN_HIDE" is enabled, in this environment using
   ctrl+space to turn on/off the xcin Chinese input mode will cause the
   xcin window "flying" upward gradually.


G. HP-UX CDE environment:
-------------------------
1. XCIN cannot start after the CDE applications (e.g., dtterm). The connection
   will not established in this case.
