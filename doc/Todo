3. Support multiple-locale handling ability in the same xcin process.

   e.g., Unicode and UTF-8.

   Add an encoding mapping layer between xcin main program and modules.

5. Redesign the IM module API to be a more secure and flexible way.

6. More modulization of the GUI part, such that changing the widget set or 
   adding vander specific GUI functions could be easy to do.

   Enhance the phrase database to increase the accuracy of intellegent 
   character selection.

   Add auto-learning ability to learn the user frequently used phrases.

8. Add a phrase input ability into gen_inp module.
   Add phrase parts into GB: pinyin.cin & shuangpin.cin.

9. Extend the rcfile reading system to support "include" syntax, and support
   reread rcfile on the fly (without restarting xcin).

10. More English documentation and man pages.

11. bims_pinyin: multiple tune5.
